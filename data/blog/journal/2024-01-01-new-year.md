In this year I would like to write an article series about Marcos Lopez de Padro's Advances in Financial Machine learning book.
I will try to summarize the chapters and add my own thoughts and experiences to it â€“ as the book is really condensed and it is hard to understand it without any prior knowledge.
I will cherry-pick the most important parts (subjectively which are the most relevant to my current work) and try to explain them in a more understandable and comprehensive way.

I would also like to review articles and books about the topic of machine learning in finance and summarize them in a similar way.
