**Securitization** is the process of pooling various interest-bearing debt instruments (like mortgages, loans, or receivables), which is then sold to investors as asset-backed securities. But what is the rationale behind this? What problem does it solve? What is its raison d'être?

The cornerstone of the fiat money system is dept and credit. In the fractional banking system banks are required to keep only a small fraction of the total assets as actual reserves. Thus, the lending capacity of the banks is limited by this reserve ratio<span className="reference" note-ref-id="2" numbered="true" content="In the US since March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve has set the reserve ratio to <strong>zero percent</strong>, effectively eliminating mandatory reserve requirements for all depository institutions in the United States. This policy change was implemented to support the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic by allowing banks greater flexibility in managing their funds. Despite the absence of reserve requirements, banks are still subject to other regulatory measures, such as <strong>capital requirements</strong>, so that equity capital can act as a buffer against loss."></span>. Securitization allows banks to free up capital by offloading loans (like mortgages), thus significantly expanding their lending capacity further.
